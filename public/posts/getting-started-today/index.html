Hello and welcome to taking your first step in learning IT today to fit your busy life.
Prerequisites
First, we will cover our prerequisites for learning IT from your chosen device today. The prerequisites are as follows:

Consistent internet connection – This can be a cell phone, a mobile hotspot, home Wi-Fi, or public Wi-Fi.
Modern email – This means you have an email from an email provider such as Gmail, Outlook, and other emails that have advanced security features that will be discussed at a later time.
Unlimited data – We will be using the internet extensively, and if you&rsquo;re limited on internet connectivity, it would be a good idea to visit public places like the local library or a franchise eatery such as Starbucks. We will cover ways to increase your security profile while using these public locations.

It&rsquo;s also understood that there are multiple devices that have simple differences. We will cover a complete concept and then provide a tailored &ldquo;how-to,&rdquo; such as our next article, which will be Create a Webpage Today.">
