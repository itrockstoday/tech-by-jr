### IT at the Speed of You

**Hello and welcome to taking your first step in learning IT today to fit your busy life.**

 *Prerequisites*
----
First, we will cover our prerequisites for learning IT from your chosen device today. The prerequisites are as follows:

1. Consistent internet connection – This can be a cell phone, a mobile hotspot, home Wi-Fi, or public Wi-Fi.
2. Modern email – This means you have an email from an email provider such as Gmail, Outlook, and other emails that have advanced security features that will be discussed at a later time.
3. Unlimited data – We will be using the internet extensively, and if you're limited on internet connectivity, it would be a good idea to visit public places like the local library or a franchise eatery such as Starbucks. We will cover ways to increase your security profile while using these public locations.

It's also understood that there are multiple devices that have simple differences. We will cover a complete concept and then provide a tailored "how-to," such as our next article, which will be Create a Webpage Today.

We will cover the concept of webpage design and how to perform this from a cellular device. The cellular device we will be starting with is the Apple iPhone, though all concepts will be covered on devices such as an Android handheld, Android tablet, iPad, and many other devices. We will also be using cloud capabilities to provide a useful and exciting experience on all platforms.
